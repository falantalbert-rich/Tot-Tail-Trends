Right now, your Payhip-connected React shop is live in code, but the next steps to make it functional and potentially profitable include:

1. **Publish the site online**  
   - Use a free host like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy your store so customers can access it.
   - Connect your custom domain (optional but helps branding).

2. **Add more high-demand, high-margin products**  
   - Research trending pet and baby products on TikTok, Instagram, and Amazon.
   - Add at least 20–30 products to appeal to more customers.

3. **Set up marketing funnels**  
   - Create TikTok & Instagram Reels showing the products in use.
   - Link your Payhip store directly in your social media bios.
   - Offer limited-time discounts or bundles.

4. **Optimize your Payhip listings**  
   - Add keyword-rich descriptions, high-quality images, and clear benefits.
   - Enable Payhip upsells and email list collection.

5. **Track & adjust**  
   - Use Payhip’s analytics + social media insights to see which products get the most clicks and sales.

If you want, I can expand your current store file to include a bigger catalog of trending products so you’re closer to that $10,000/month goal.
